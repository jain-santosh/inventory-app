Key Modules for a Jewellery Shop Management App

Building a management application for a jewellery store requires a specialized set of modules due to the high value of items, the complexity of inventory (metals, stones, designs), and the unique services offered (like repairs and custom orders).

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the modules to consider.

Phase 1: The Core Modules (MVP)

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) needed to run the basic operations of the store.

1. Inventory Management

This is the most critical and complex module. It must be highly detailed.

Product Cataloging: Ability to add items with fields for:

Metals: Type (Gold, Platinum, Silver), Purity (e.g., 22k, 18k), Net Weight, Gross Weight.

Stones: Details for diamonds (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carat - the 4Cs), and other gemstones.

SKU/Serial Number: A unique ID for every single piece.

Hallmarking/Certification: Fields for HUID (Hallmark Unique ID) and other certification numbers (e.g., GIA).

Images: Multiple high-resolution images for each item.

Stock Tracking: Differentiate between:

Finished Goods: Ready-to-sell items.

Raw Materials: Loose stones, metal bars, and other components.

Barcode/RFID Management: Generate and print tags for each item to allow for quick scanning at POS and during audits.

Stock Auditing: Features to help with the physical verification of high-value stock.

2. Point of Sale (POS) & Billing

The "cash register" module, tailored for jewellery.

Sales & Billing:

Scan items via barcode.

Calculate price based on: Metal weight, live metal rate (if possible), stone value, making charges, and wastage.

Handle taxes (e.g., GST) correctly.

Payment Processing: Accept multiple payment types (cash, credit/debit card, digital wallets, gift vouchers).

Returns & Exchanges: Process returns, buy-backs, and exchanges, with logic for calculating the value of old gold.

Salesperson Tracking: Assign each sale to a salesperson to track commissions and performance.

3. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Essential for building loyalty with high-value clients.

Customer Profiles: Store customer details, purchase history, and contact information.

Important Dates: Track anniversaries, birthdays, etc., for sending reminders and special offers.

Clienteling: Store customer preferences, ring sizes, and wish lists to provide personalized service.

Phase 2: Core Operations Modules

These modules handle the unique services and backend operations of a jewellery business.

4. Order & Service Management

This module tracks all custom work and after-sales services.

Custom Order Management:

Create a new order ticket, capturing customer requirements, designs (ability to upload a sketch), and estimated cost.

Track deposits and due dates.

Repair & Service Tracking:

Log items (from the customer or other stores) coming in for repair.

Create a job ticket with details of the service needed.

Attach pre-repair photos to document the item's condition.

Track the status (e.g., "Pending," "With Artisan," "Ready for Pickup").

Karigar (Artisan) Management:

Assign custom/repair jobs to internal or external artisans (karigars).

Track the movement of metal and stones issued to them.

Track the items returned, calculating metal loss/wastage.

5. Procurement & Supplier Management

Manages how you get your stock.

Supplier Database: Maintain a list of vendors for metals, stones, and finished goods.

Purchase Orders: Create and track purchase orders for raw materials and stock.

Bullion Management: Specifically track the purchase and sale of raw metal (gold/silver bullion).

Phase 3: Advanced & Administrative Modules

These modules help with business intelligence, security, and scaling.

6. Reporting & Analytics

Provides insights into the health of the business.

Sales Reports: Daily sales, top-selling items, salesperson performance.

Inventory Reports: Stock aging (how long an item has been in stock), fast-moving vs. slow-moving items, stock valuation.

Customer Reports: Top buyers, customers by purchase frequency.

Tax Reports: Generate reports required for tax filing (e.g., GST reports).

7. User Management & Security

Controls who can access what.

User Roles: Define roles (e.g., Admin, Store Manager, Sales Associate, Cashier).

Role-Based Permissions: Restrict access to sensitive information. For example, a Sales Associate can make a sale, but only a Manager can approve a high-value discount or view profit reports.

Audit Trail: Log all major actions (e.g., "User X deleted item Y," "User Z changed the price of item A") for security and accountability.

8. Integrations & Optional Modules

Accounting Integration: Sync sales and purchase data with accounting software (like Tally, QuickBooks, or Zoho Books).

E-commerce Integration: Sync your in-store inventory with an online store (like Shopify or WooCommerce).

Live Metal Rate: An API integration to pull daily gold/silver/platinum rates to ensure accurate pricing.
